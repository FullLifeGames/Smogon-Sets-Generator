Smogon Sets Generator
=======================

This makes the crawled data from Smogon into .ekx files.

How to compile it and find the code:
- open the project with Microsoft Visual Studio
- go into the PKX folder and enhance the f1-Main.cs
- double click on the Form1
- you should see my code now, make sure to edit the pokegenfolder and the workingfolder if you're using this, otherwise it will crash!
